# Chapter 17. Greedy Algorithms and Invariants

- Greedy: algorithms computing solution in steps; at each step, algorithm makes a decision that is locally optimum, and never changes that decision.
- Greedy does **not** necessarily produce optimum solution.

## Tips

- Greedy is right choice for **optimization** problem where there is a natural set of choices to select from.
- Easier to conceptualize greedy recursively, and implement iteratively for higher performance.
- Sometimes greedy is **not** obvious.
