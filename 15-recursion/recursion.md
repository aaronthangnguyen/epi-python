# Recursion

- Recursion: an approach where solution depends partially on solutions to smaller instances of related problems.
- Scenarios: seaching, enumeration, divide-and-conquer, and decomposing a complex problem into smaller instances
- Recursive function: base cases and calls with different arguments
- Divide-and-conquer: merge sort, quicksort

# Bootcamp

- Euclidean algorithm
- Divide-and-conquer algorithm

- Recursion is suitable when input ix expressed using recursive rules, i.e. computer grammar
- Good for search, enumeration, and divide-and-conquer
- Recursion is alternative to deeply nested iterations
- To remove recursion, imitate call stack with stack data structure
- Recursion can be removed from tail recursive program using while loop
- If recursive function use already existing arguments more than once, cache arguments
