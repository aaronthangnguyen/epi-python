# Chapter 16. Dynamic Programming

- DP: general technique for solving optimization, search, and counting problems that can be decomposed into subproblems
- Consider DP when have to make choices to solve, specifically, solution relates to subproblems
- DP efficient because caching results of intermeditate computation

- Break problem to subproblems:
  - Original problem solved easily if subproblems are solved
  - Subproblems are cached
