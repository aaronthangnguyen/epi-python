# Arrays

- O(n) -> O(1) by using existing array
- Write values from the back, if possible
- Overwrite > delete
- If integers encoded by array, process digits from the back. Alternatively, reverse array so the least-significant is the first entry (from the back?)
- Off-by-zero
- Integrity of array does not matter until return
- 2D arrays, parallel logic
- If easier, simulate the specification
